Prompt Log – Feature Voting System

---

User: "For each prompt I give you, write to a file prompts.txt, so I can audit the work."
Assistant: Confirmed and began logging prompts.

User: "What to Build
You’ll be given the following mini-project:
Feature Voting System – Let users post a feature and upvote others
The project must have:
● A database
● A backend API
● A frontend UI: CHOOSE ONE native mobile: iOS or Android

✅ What We’ll Be Evaluating
We’ll score your project based on:
Category What We’re Looking For
Prompting Skills Clear, structured, layered prompts; follow-up iterations
Tool Orchestration Using AI for DB, backend, frontend, tests, and docs
System Thinking Logical flow between components; modular and realistic
Functionality End-to-end flow works (even if basic)
Multi-Platform Output Working UI for web + mobile (can be basic)
Debugging / Edge Cases Smart handling of errors or flow problems
Prompt Logs or Notes Submit the prompts you used, describing what you asked the
AI to do
You don’t need styling or pixel-perfect UI. We care about logic, AI collaboration, and your
decision-making process."

User: "before you start building this step-by-step, I like to know if it is possible to use python for the backend or as much as possible in the project as I am more familiar and comfortable with it. What are the trade-offs?"

---

User: "let's go"

---

User: "I need to be able to push this project to GitHub so it needs to be organized like a repo where one can download my project and run on their computer"

User: "how to make this Markdown friendly?"

---

User: "<<ImageDisplayed>>I get this on Markdown rendering"

---

User: "I am trying to find if xcode is installed on my machine by doing
xcode-select -p
and it returns
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
however I can't seem to find an executable file to open xcode"

---

User: "I need tests for both back and frontend"

---

User: "from app.main import app is not importing app"

User: "<<ImageDisplayed>>this is the structure, and it is still not importing"

---

The file “FeatureVotingApp.xcodeproj” couldn’t be saved in the folder “FeatureVotingApp”."

---

User: "my FeatureVotingApp.xcodeproj file is empty"

---

User: "what about storage for choose option for your new project?"

---

User: "<<ImageDisplayed>>this is what I got, how do I run the project now"

---

User: "back end is running and xcode built the project but all it shows is a hello world and a few failures"

---

User: "why didn't we have FeatureListView from the start?"

---

User: "what about addfeatureview.swift? Does that need to be added as well?"

---

User: "<<ImageDisplayed>>all I have now is this screen and those failures..."

---

User: "why there are feature 1 (test desc) and feature 2(desc) if I didn't create anything?"

---

User: "so how do I create users?"

---

User: "yes, I also can't vote via the UI not select users to vote"

---

User: "<<ImageDisplayed>>still not working and it seems like the target membership is selected correctly"

---

---

User: "in the UI I can now create and select the user, But I can vote more than once with the same user in the same feature. How do I prevent the same user from voting more than once in each feature?"

---

User: "yes"

---

User: "If a vote fails with HTTP 400, we show an alert: “You’ve already voted for this feature”
has this been done yet?"

---

User: "now let's update our python and swift tests to include the lastest changes"

---

User: "my current frontend instructions are: ... let's improve with all the steps we did to get this running on xcode so someone that doesn't know xcode can make it work"

---

User: "you failed to mention it to create the files such as APIService that are not in xcode after you open the project file"

---

User: "no, we ran out of time. please give me prompt.txt so I can save in my project for review"
